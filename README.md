# COMUTER-VISION-QUIZ-USING-WEBCAM-THROUGH-HAND-GESTURE-MOVEMENTS
Nowadays, computer-based multiple-choice exams are used nearly universally in the recruitment, examination, and other processes. Making the setting for a computer-based test is very expensive because it requires a lot of equipment and software. We are putting out a project that will use computer vision to lessen the hardware setup required for computer-based exams, such as a keyboard and mouse. The proposed project will first save the question to a csv file before utilizing computer vision to show it on screen. Secondly, using a webcam and computer vision, we will look for hand gestures in the air that can be utilized to answer the questions that are being displayed. Finally, the automatic grading mechanism in it will reveal the grade. This method made it simple to answer questions and even made the evaluation process simple. Importantly, because of very little technology is needed, the exam won't be terminated in the middle due to a hardware fault or malfunction.
# Objectives :
The major goal is to suggest a computer-based MCQ test system that makes use of computer vision and a camera. With the help of this method, the exam can be artificially administered using hand gestures. In order to answer the question, we use hand gestures in this project. To achieve this, we track the hands with the use of computer vision, utilizing Media Pipe to perform palm detection and hand landmark detection. Finally, the automatic grading mechanism in it will reveal the grade.
# Scope of the Project : 
The system's installation and upkeep won't set you back much money. This system made it simple to answer questions and even made the evaluation process simple. Importantly, because of very little technology is needed, the exam won't be terminated in the middle due to a hardware fault or malfunction.
