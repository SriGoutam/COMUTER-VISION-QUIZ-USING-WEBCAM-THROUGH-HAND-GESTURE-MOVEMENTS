# COMUTER-VISION-QUIZ-USING-WEBCAM-THROUGH-HAND-GESTURE-MOVEMENTS
Nowadays, computer-based multiple-choice exams are used universally in the recruitment, examination, and other processes. Making the setup for a computer-based test is very expensive because it requires a lot of equipment and software. We’re working on a project that will employ computer vision to reduce the amount of hardware, like a keyboard and mouse, needed for computer-based exams. The suggested solution would use computer vision to display the question on screen after saving it to a csv file first. Second, we willsearch for hand movements in the air that can be used to respond to the presented questions using a webcam and computer vision. The automatic grading system in it will then display the grade. This approach made it easy to respond to questions and even made the evaluation procedure straightforward. To verify that no malpractice occurred during the exam, this technology ensures more security by counting the number of people who are in front of the webcam, if more than one person the exam automatically ends. This technique had a 95.7% success rate in accurately detecting hands. Importantly, because of very little technology is needed, the exam won’t be terminated in the middle due to a hardware failure or malfunction.

# Objectives :
The major goal is to suggest a computer-based MCQ test system that makes use of computer vision and a camera. With the help of this method, the exam can be artificially administered using hand gestures. In order to answer the question, we use hand gestures in this project. To achieve this, we track the hands with the use of computer vision, utilizing Media Pipe to perform palm detection and hand landmark detection. Finally, the automatic grading mechanism in it will reveal the grade.

# Scope of the Project : 
The system's installation and upkeep won't set you back much money. This system made it simple to answer questions and even made the evaluation process simple. Importantly, because of very little technology is needed, the exam won't be terminated in the middle due to a hardware fault or malfunction.
